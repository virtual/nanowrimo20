title: "All is Lost (75%-80%)"
pages: 37,500
summary: "The opposite moment from the Midpoint: “awful”/“great”. The moment that the main character realizes they’ve lost everything they gained, or everything they now have has no meaning. The initial goal now looks even more impossible than before. And here, something or someone dies. It can be physical or emotional, but the death of something old makes way for something new to be born."

I stepped on, trying to contain the exhilaration as I glided my hand along the smooth side of the boat. Finally, I was on my battlefield. I could impress him without using fancy looks or flicking my hips. 

The wind had caught my hair, and I realized that this would be a good moment to shove it up in a hair clip. Of course, I didn't want to lead on my boss, but I also didn't look like a sea monster. 

Sidestepping to one corner, my fingers darted quickly into my backpack. Grazing the top of my tissue pack, sunglasses and the crinkly wrapper of an eaten candy bar, they arrived at the hard plastic. With a small effort, I wiggled the hairclip out and whipped it out of my bag like a trophy. 

_Ah ha!_

As my gaze followed my unearthed treasure, I noticed a familiar face in the distance. The slightly ungroomed hair. The green eyes with the silly smile. My face distorted in its own smile as I tried to process the picture in front of me.

"Cindy, this is my son, Nathaniel." _Nathaniel._ My mind instantly turned to the slight smudge that never seemed to leave his nametag. _"My son is an International liason..."_ No. Those were all... lies?

Hoping that he hadn't noticed the lull in my step, my hand eventually flew out towards Nathaniel's own. 

"Nice to meet you, Nathaniel."

The line of his smile didn't flicker--polite but knowing. "Thanks. Nice to meet you as well."
