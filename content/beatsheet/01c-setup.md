Still believing something is wrong but not sure how to confront it, she goes to work the next day (Friday) and tells coworkers she will be on leave for awhile. One of her coworkers/friend asks to take her to coffee. (Anxious, she discusses a lost trinket she's kept from an audience member.)

Quip about there still being long lines for coffee. After talking with a friend--possibly about the sister history in the theme. Friend might state the theme.

She goes home and after a couple anxiety pills, she builds up the confidence to call her dad.
