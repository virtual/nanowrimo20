Reyna has spent her life trying to find her own path, in order to separate herself from the high bar set by her sister's life of academic achievement. Though they both spent years learning about space and the worlds around them, Reyna refused following her sister into work with the space academy. She finds she can only subdue her social anxiety while acting out other's lives on the stage. After discussing the mysterious details of her sister's death with her estranged father, she digs into the unknown side of her sister's life. As her world sends her directions she would never expect, she learns that although her anxiety seems to hinder her goals, she can still help others to fulfill meaningful lives. And maybe with a little bit of acting, she can unearth her buried dreams of working in space.
