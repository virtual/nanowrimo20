Angry that the man was focused on her space knowledge and not her acting skills, she leaves dinner at the fancy place. He says the same: "if you had wanted to go into acting, you've already passed up those opportunities."

Near the exit, she is recognized by a random man who suggests she audition for a role w/ a “star actor.” Eager to make a point, she agrees to stop by auditions next week. NFCs contact information to the man.

Discusses the space opportunity with her friend. Suggested that this could be her “biggest part yet!” and thinking of the fame and glory, she tentatively accepts.

Later, she is phoned the time/place and finds out the audition try-outs are the same time as the orientation.
