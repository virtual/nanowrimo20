As she contemplates the man who acted again (is he important?), she also reminisces on her father and sister. How he had been supportive until ? and then once his sister went to school to study space, had lost interest in her own wellbeing. 

She considers that her sister hasn't texted her yet, and although she knows something is wrong, she puts off calling her father. (She has often put off important feelings.)

She thinks about how her sister had gone off to work on a space project--she had always been so smart and easygoing. She wishes she could be like her. She thinks about the scar on her arm and how she had gotten it while trying to race her sister in something when she was really young. Maybe this was the last time she had tried to outdo her sister.
