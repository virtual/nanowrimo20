The boy’s mother gives her a call and tells her that he agreed to meet with her.
She’s excited, but anxious. 

When she goes to a local shop, she sees an older photo of her swim team with the swim team and her (coach). The man does not look the same as she had remembered.

They meet for coffee, but he tells her that it was a mistake and that he shouldn’t ever be involved in her life. It is a risk for everyone. She’s sure they can make it work.
